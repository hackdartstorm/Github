Ahh the birth of a repo moment 🐣✨ :-
    git init means:
“Start tracking this folder with Git.”
It turns a normal folder into a Git repository.

1.Untracked Files :-
 👉 Git is basically saying:
“I see this file in the folder, but you never told me to track it.”
Move it to tracking:
    git add notes.txt

2.Modified (UnStaged) :-
 👉 Git is saying:
“You changed this file, but you haven’t chosen to include the changes in the next snapshot.”
Move it to staged:
    git add notes.txt

3️⃣ Staged — “Ready to be saved in the next commit” :-
 👉 Git is saying:
“Cool, I’ll include this in the next version.”
Save it permanently:
    git commit -m "Update app logic"

----------------------------------------------x----------------------------------------------------
🧩 “Checkpoint” in Git = Commit


✅ Set a checkpoint
    git add .
    git commit -m "Checkpoint: login feature working"

"-m" means message
That commit becomes a restore point you can return to anytime.


You can see all checkpoints:
    git log --oneline

Example output:
    a3f9c2d Add login validation
    8b21e7a Checkpoint: login feature working
    4d8a1ff Initial project setup
Each line = one checkpoint.


📝 Git Reset Notes :-
    🔹 git reset --soft <commit>
Use when: You only want to undo the commit, not the work.
    ✔ HEAD moves back
    ✔ Commit is undone
    ✔ All changes stay STAGED
    ✔ Nothing deleted
👉 Meaning: “Undo the commit, keep everything ready to commit again.”

🔹 git reset --mixed <commit> (default)
Use when: You want to undo the commit and re-choose what to add.
    ✔ HEAD moves back
    ✔ Commit is undone
    ✔ Files become MODIFIED (unstaged)
    ✔ Nothing deleted
👉 Meaning: “Undo the commit, but unstage the files so I can edit/select again.”

🔹 git reset --hard <commit>
Use when: You want to completely go back and erase everything after that point.
    ✔ HEAD moves back
    ❌ Staging area cleared
    ❌ Working files reset
    ❌ All changes after that commit deleted
👉 Meaning: “Go back exactly to that version and delete all later work.”

🪄 Magic recovery trick :-
Run:
    git reflog
You’ll see something like:
    f3a9c1d HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to B
    9ab21e4 HEAD@{1}: commit: Safety checkpoint before experiment
That second line is your lost commit!
Bring it back:
    git reset --hard 9ab21e4
Boom 💥 checkpoint restored.
