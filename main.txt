Ahh the birth of a repo moment 🐣✨ :-
    git init means:
“Start tracking this folder with Git.”
It turns a normal folder into a Git repository.

1.Untracked Files :-
 👉 Git is basically saying:
“I see this file in the folder, but you never told me to track it.”
Move it to tracking:
    git add notes.txt

2.Modified (Not Staged) :-
 👉 Git is saying:
“You changed this file, but you haven’t chosen to include the changes in the next snapshot.”
Move it to staged:
    git add notes.txt

3️⃣ Staged — “Ready to be saved in the next commit” :-
 👉 Git is saying:
“Cool, I’ll include this in the next version.”
Save it permanently:
    git commit -m "Update app logic"

----------------------------------------------x----------------------------------------------------
🧩 “Checkpoint” in Git = Commit


✅ Set a checkpoint
    git add .
    git commit -m "Checkpoint: login feature working"
That commit becomes a restore point you can return to anytime.


You can see all checkpoints:
    git log --oneline

Example output:
    a3f9c2d Add login validation
    8b21e7a Checkpoint: login feature working
    4d8a1ff Initial project setup
Each line = one checkpoint.

💣 git reset --hard (BIG hammer)
This command says:
    “Take me back to an old checkpoint and delete everything after it.”
It resets:
    Working folder 🧾
    Staging area 📦
    Commit history (after that point) 🕒
🔥 Go back to a previous commit

Steps-to-do :-
1️⃣ Find the commit ID
    git log --oneline
    Copy the short code:
    8b21e7a
2️⃣ Reset to it
    git reset --hard 8b21e7a
Now your project looks exactly like it did at that commit.

⚠️ Warning (serious)
If you didn’t push the commits anywhere and you hard reset…
    👉 Those commits are basically lost
    👉 Git has no undo button (for beginners)
So only use --hard when you’re sure.


🪄 Magic recovery trick :-
Run:
    git reflog
You’ll see something like:
    f3a9c1d HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to B
    9ab21e4 HEAD@{1}: commit: Safety checkpoint before experiment
That second line is your lost commit!
Bring it back:
    git reset --hard 9ab21e4
Boom 💥 checkpoint restored.
